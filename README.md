# An Introduction To Machine Learning

**Illustration here**

Welcome to this practical introduction to machine learning! 

The goal of this series of tutorials is to get you started with machine learning fast and easy, so that you can then feel comfortable using it at work (or just for fun).

If you'd like to try machine learning for the first time, you're at the right place. The only prerequisite is a vague knowledge of any programming language. Here, we're going to use python, which is ruling the field at the moment.

We're not going to bother much about theory, mathematics, statistics. Instead, we'll focus on practical exercises. You'll get your feets wet for the tools commonly used in research and the industry, and you'll build a real feeling for machine learning.
