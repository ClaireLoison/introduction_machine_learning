# An Introduction To Machine Learning

Welcome to this practical introduction to machine learning! 

The goal of this series of tutorials is to get you started with machine learning fast and easy, so that you can then feel comfortable using it at work. 

If you'd like to try machine learning for the first time, you're at the right place. The only prerequisite is a vague knowledge of any programming language. Here, we're going to use python, which is ruling the field at the moment.

We're not going to bother much about theory, mathematics, statistics. Instead, we'll focus on practical exercises. You'll get your hands on the tools that are commonly used in research and the industry, and you'll build a feeling for machine learning.  

So here's a brief outline of the material that we will cover. 

1. Install python for machine learning
* Minimal python for machine learning: 
  * Python basics : variables, loops, functions, data structures
  * Numpy arrays : efficient data manipulation in python
  * Plotting with matplotlib
  * Tips : most useful python packages, notebooks & IDEs.
* Basic machine learning 1: Classification: 
* Basic machine learning 2: regression and unsupervised learning
* Deep learning 1: convolutional neural networks, transfer learning
* Deep learning 2: u-nets, GANs, auto-encoders

So let's get started! 


## Install python for machine learning

In most tutorials, we will run our code on remote platform, in which everything we need is preinstalled: 

* For sections 2. to 5., we will use Google Colab, which is great for short tests and small datasets. 
* For section 5., we will use FloydHub, which is more adapted to real-life deep learning problems. 

We'll come back to that. 

That being said, in this section, you will learn how to install everything you need on your own machine, so that you're actually ready to get started with machine learning on your own.
