    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to this practical introduction to machine learning! \n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of these lectures is to get you started with machine learning fast and easy, so that you can then feel comfortable using it at work (or just for fun).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to try machine learning for the first time, you're at the right place. The only prerequisite is a vague knowledge of any programming language. Here, we're going to use python, which is ruling the field at the moment.\n",
    "\n",
    "We're not going to bother much about theory, mathematics, statistics. Instead, we'll focus on practical exercises. You'll get your feets wet for the tools commonly used in research and the industry, and you'll build a real feeling for machine learning.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Outline\n",
    "\n",
    "The lectures are organized as a series of modules: \n",

    "## Python Basics for Machine Learning \n",
    "\n",
    "At the moment, python is ruling the fields of data science and machine learning, after a long period of domination by R. So we think that you need to know this language to be able to use machine learning efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "But what if you've never used python?\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we'll assume you're not a professional software developer, and we'll give you the basics that are necessary for machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "We hope that we'll give you a starting point and the motivation to learn more about this wonderful language. We can assure you that you won't regret it.\n",
    "\n",
    "* [Python crash course](notebooks/python_crash_course/01_python_crash_course_for_machine_learning.ipynb) (1h)\n",
    "   * Learn the minimum needed about python for machine learning: loops, data structures, etc.\n",
    "* [Introduction to Numpy](notebooks/python_crash_course/02_numpy_for_machine_learning.ipynb) (1h)\n",
    "   * Numpy provides efficient data array manipulation and it at the core of scientific python, including machine learning. \n",
    "* [First plots with matplotlib](notebooks/python_crash_course/03_plotting_for_machine_learning.ipynb) (1h) \n",
    "   * Matplotlib is the oldest and most well known data visualization tool for python. Learn how to do your first plots, in the context of a toy machine learning problem. \n",
